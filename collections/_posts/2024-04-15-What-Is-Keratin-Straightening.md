  What is Keratin Straightening?
  </h3>
  <section>
    <p>
    Keratin is a protein naturally found in hair. Keratin straightening treatments infuse additional keratin into your hair and help lock in the shape with heat. Lisa has less expensive options that work for a couple months as well as premium options that last 3-6 months (depending on hair type and after care).

    <b>During a keratin straightening treatment:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Your hair is cleansed to remove product buildup.
    </li>
    <li>
    A keratin solution is applied, infusing your hair with this protein.
    </li>
    <li>
    Heat styling with a blow dryer and flat iron locks in the treatment, straightening your hair and creating a protective layer.
    </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Consultation is key!</b> Lisa will fist evaluate your hair type and health and then determine what your goals are and which keratin straightening is right for you specifically.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Formaldehyde-free options exist!</b> Some treatments contain formaldehyde, which can have health risks. Lisa DOES NOT use any of those treatments. She uses modern alternatives that produce similar results and are healthier for you and your hair.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Results aren't permanent, but they last!</b> Less expensive keratin straightening treatments last for 1-2 months. Premium keratin straightening treatments can last as long as 3-6 months. In both cases, it depends on your hair type and how well you care for it after the treatment.
    </li>
    <b>Simple aftercare for lasting results:</b> Using sulfate-free shampoo and avoiding tight hairstyles for a few days will maximize the treatment's effects and help it last longer.
