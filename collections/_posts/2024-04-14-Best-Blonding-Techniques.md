    What Are Blonding Techniques?
  </h3>
  <section>
    <p>
    Blonding techniques are chemical services that lighten hair by removing pigment and making the hair appear blond. This can also be referred to as "bleaching" hair but modern practices are much safer. However, the process can still damage hair and make it brittle, so it should only be performed by a stylist with enough experience to know how much they can "push the envelope" before compromising hair integrity.
    </p>

    The hair lightening techniques in most demand are: Highlights, Babylights, Balayage, Ombre, Dimensional Highlights, Platinum Blonde, and Grey Blends. Lisa regularly performs all of these services with consistently amazing results.

    The skills of the hair stylist is more important than the specific technique they use. While social media trends periodically spike, a skilled stylist can achieve many different custom looks using a combination of techniques. Lisa stays educated on the latest blonding techniques and uses whichever techniques are needed for each unique situation.

    That said, some techniques are better than others for specific situations. For example, clay based lighteners allow more precise application and it can be applied almost like hand painting. This is why Balayage costs more. However, other application techniques, foil techniques, and blending techniques can be used to achieve a wide range of affects.

    Ultimately, the technique doesn't matter as much as having a stylist with the right artistic vision, experience with a wide variety of hair types, and the skills to be able to execute them correctly.

    Can All Hair Stylists Lighten Hair?
  </h3>

    <p>
    While all hair stylists are capable of creating blond hair by lightening, not many are expert enough or artistic enough to produce amazing looking results. This is similar to the fact that anyone can paint a picture with paint, but not many will be able to create a beautiful work of art.
