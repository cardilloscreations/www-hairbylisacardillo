    Special Considerations For Vibrant Hair Color
  </h3>
  <section>
    <p>
    While these wild colors are fun and bold, there are a few special considerations to be aware of. Lisa can help you understand these in more detail but they include:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Hair health:</b> Bleaching hair, often required for lighter artistic colors, can damage hair. Your hair must be healthy enough to handle the process, or it would need to be done in multiple sessions.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Maintenance:</b> Artistic hair color may require more frequent touch-ups than natural shades. Reduced shampooing and special products can help, but they do tend to fade faster than traditional hair color.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Lifestyle:</b> If you have a job with a strict dress code, artistic hair color might not be the best choice. However, many clients like to have a hidden peek-a-boo color that is easy to hide while at work, and easy to reveal other times.
    </li>
    </ul>
