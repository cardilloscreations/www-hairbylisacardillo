  Experience is Your Trusted Ally
  </h3>

  Finding Your Personality Match
  </h3>
  <section>
    <p>
    A good hair stylist isn't just about technical skills. Consider your personality too! You're going to be spending time with them and it should be enjoyable.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Chatty Cathy or Quiet Contemplator?</b> Do you prefer a stylist who chats the whole time or one who respects your need for quiet relaxation? It's actually best to communicate this directly to your stylist.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>The Visionary or the Collaborator?</b> Do you have a clear picture of what you want, or do you crave a stylist's creative input? Your stylist may not agree, and since your hair is their billboard, an honest stylist will tell you that. Others may just do their own thing anyways, leaving you with something you don't like.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Sense of Humor Matters:</b> Humor can ease the nerves! Look for a stylist whose personality meshes well with yours, making the salon experience enjoyable.
    </li>
    </ul>
